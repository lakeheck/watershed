strange attractor 

swampy
tattoo + album art + print 
bonus: something that would work for concert visuals as well

i think i want to do a heirarchal approach, with various parts of the work performing
the attendant functions below: 
- texture or fill algorithm will be the detail
- large structure will make up composition 

want to start with some general attractor based flow field 
- the lines of the field will be composed of polygons following the field 
- the interior of the polygons will be GeoMetricSubdivisions 
- ideally we will only fill selection of the polygons to give the sense of depth 
- i think selectively showing them (or perhaps by altering scale or distortion) we 
could effectively evoke the feeling of growth or decay (e.g. use noise based flow field to adjust the relative transparency, brightness, thickness, or area of shapes)

NOTES 
- thomas or sprott attractors have the best patterns for a single attractor in 2nd
