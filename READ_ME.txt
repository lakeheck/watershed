i want to use this repo as the basis for my ongoing work 

algorithms will be added to the library when they are in a sufficiently abstracted state, 
however i should not strive for library additions but rather make them only when a clear use case arises 

naming conventions for branchs (?)
- descriptive name
- include month and year 
- "study" should be used for branches to investigate a specific aspect. ideally these are all branched from master 
- dev should have most of the heavy lifting
